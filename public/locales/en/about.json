CollAction is the platform that connects people to make positive impact together - Power to the Crowd! We do so by making it simple and enjoyable for users to take part in our CrowdActions. We believe this is the only way to reach a public that crosses cities, countries and continents. Therefore, our mission is to make doing good fun and easy! Want to know how we do this exactly?

    "title": "History",
    "description": "CollAction was founded in 2016 by Ron van den Akker and Spencer Heijnen. After great successes with fashion-related CrowdActions, their team decided to focus solely on SlowFashion in 2020. Since we still strongly believe that there's room for CollAction in this world, we formed a new team in 2021 that is rapidly expanding and ready to take on the challenges of today."
