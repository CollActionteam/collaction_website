In short: they allow us to keep making positive impact. In return, if you become a donor you get full insight into our expenses so you know what we do with your donation. For generous donors we organise a yearly vegan dinner together with other donors and the CollAction team. Additionally, these donors receive a special upcycled CollAction bag made from recycled chips bags!",
