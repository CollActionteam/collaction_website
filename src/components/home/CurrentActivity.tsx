          <p>
            CollAction was founded in 2015 by Ron van den Akker and Spencer
            Heijnen. After great successes with fashion-related crowdactions,
            their team decided to focus solely on{" "}
            <a className="text-collaction" href="https://slowfashion.global/">
              SlowFashion
            </a>{" "}
            in 2020. As there is still strong confidence that there&apos;s room
            for CollAction in this world, a new team has formed in 2021 and is
            expanding rapidly.
