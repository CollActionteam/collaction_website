In September weâ€™ll make the campus prettier by doing a start-of-the-year clean up. From September 13-16 you can hand in your electronic and bulk waste (grof afval) at the red circle below in return for vouchers. On September 17, 20 & 27 you can join us to collect litter (zwerfafval) around the campus to make it shine again!
