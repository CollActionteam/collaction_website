              We connect people to solve collective action problems. We aspire
              to make doing good fun & easy. CollAction is an Amsterdam-based
              non-profit Public Benefit Organisation. Our team has grown from 3
              to 21 international volunteers since July 2021 and we are
              currently building a native app to solve collective action
              problems. Our focus is on sustainability-related issues. Our
              organisational goal is to be a self-sustaining non-profit that
              functions independently from donations. Through a paid version of
              our product for companies and municipalities, we aspire to
              financially compensate everyone on the team in the future.
            </p>

            <h4 className="text-primary-400 mb-7">Commitment</h4>
            <p className="mb-6 ">
              CollAction is a non-profit organisation and is currently run by
              volunteers only. We are not able to provide a salary at this
              point, therefore: your commitment to CollAction is exactly what
              you want it to be. You are not expected to deliver something that
              does not fit your schedule. We love proactive people that take
              initiative, however: this works best if you are honest about what
              can realistically be done, given your individual schedule. There
              is no shame in saying no to certain tasks or in reaching out to
              someone on the team to help out if you donâ€™t have the means to
              finish a task you committed to.
